Samira's attacks in melee range deal additional magic damage, increased with the target missing health. Samira's attacks against enemies affected by Immobilizing effects Knock Up for 0.5 seconds and deal damage over 6 separate attacks. Samira dashes into range against targets slightly outside of her attack range."

Either hit can critically strike for 25% bonus damage. If cast during Wild Rush, Samira will strike all enemies in her path upon completion."
